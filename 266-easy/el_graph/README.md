# ElGraph

##Intro
This week I'll be posting a series of challenges on graph theory. I picked a series of challenges that can help introduce you to the concepts and terminology, I hope you find it interesting and useful.

##Description
In graph theory, the degree of a node is the number of edges coming into it or going out of it - how connected it is. For this challenge you'll be calculating the degree of every node.
Input Description

##Input description
First you'll be given an integer, N, on one line showing you how many nodes to account for. Next you'll be given an undirected graph as a series of number pairs, a and b, showing that those two nodes are connected - an edge. Example:
`3 
1 2
1 3`

##Output description
Your program should emit the degree for each node. Example:
`Node 1 has a degree of 2
Node 2 has a degree of 1
Node 3 has a degree of 1`

##Bonus
Bonus 1) Create an adjascensy matrix from the same input
